# Employee-Retention-Analytics-Classifying-Attrition-Risks
I'm excited to introduce my project titled **Employee Retention Analytics: Classifying Attrition Risks**! ðŸš€

In this project, I addressed the critical challenge of employee retention by employing predictive modeling techniques on a synthetic dataset provided by IBM. High employee turnover can lead to significant costs and disruptions for organizations, making it essential to understand and predict attrition effectively.

### Project Highlights:
- **Objective**: To analyze factors influencing employee attrition and develop a model that predicts the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization.
- **Dataset**: The analysis is based on the "HR-Employee-Attrition.csv" dataset, which includes various attributes such as age, job role, salary, and work-life balance.
- **Model Performance**: Several machine learning models were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting attrition:
  - **Logistic Regression**: 85.3%
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**: 83.5%
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: 87.2%
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: 84.1%
  - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: 86.7%

### Methodology:
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.
- **Model Development**: Implemented various machine learning algorithms using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Insights**: The project provides valuable insights into the key predictors of employee attrition, enabling organizations to implement strategies to enhance retention.
